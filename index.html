                    <p>
                        The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to
                        developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm proud to announce that I am not working at one of the world's largest communities teaching
                        young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
                        opportunities.

                        As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is
                        yourself.

                        "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone
                        through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a
                        leader in something you're passionate about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
